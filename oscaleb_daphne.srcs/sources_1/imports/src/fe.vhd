-- DAPHNE FPGA AFE front end. This module does the following:
-- send master clock 62.5MHz to AFEs
-- receive high speed LVDS serial data from the AFEs, 
-- deskew and convert to 14 bit parallel bus in the master clock domain
--
-- Each high speed LVDS input feeds into an IDELAY + ISERDES.
--
-- You will notice that the high speed clock from the AFE chip is not used here. The reason for this is that it is not required. This FPGA sends
-- a copy of the master clock 62.5MHz to each AFE. Therefore each AFE chip is frequency locked to the FPGA master clock. The phase relationship,
-- however, is not known, but that is calibrated out using the IDELAY primitives. Thus this module REQUIRES manual calibration on each channel 
-- (LVDS pair) Here's how:
--
-- 1. Place the AFE into fixed data pattern mode, let's assume it is "11 1111 1000 0000"
-- 2. Adjust the IDELAY value to find the center of the bit
--    2.1 observe the parallel word for the channel you are adjusting. it doesn't really matter what the 
--        value is. what you're looking for is when it begins to change. start with a delay value in the middle
--    2.2 decrement the delay value, watching the parallel word each time. when the value changes you're at the edge of the bit
--        note this value.
--    2.3 reset the delay value to the center, then increment the delay until the parallel words begins to change again
--        this is the other edge of the bit. note this value
--    2.4 choose a delay value in the middle of the 2 values you found. this is the center of the bit. write this into the IDELAY.
--        this concludes the fine timing adjustment for the channel.
-- 3. The parallel word should now be stable and unchanging, but likely it will be shifted by some number of bits, e.g.
--    it might look like this: "11 1111 0000 0001". Assert BITSLIP for one clock cycle, then observe the parallel word. Keep going 
--    until it looks like what you'd expect.
-- 4. Done!
--
-- The link alignment process is a MANUAL PROCESS that should be done EVERY time the FPGA is configured. At some point we may
-- get fancy and make this process fully automatic.
